# docs — generate the opencharly.ai site

`charly docs generate` emits the generated half of the documentation site published at
**opencharly.ai** from the sources that already exist in this repository. It is served by
`candy/plugin-docs`.

## R4 — documentation never routes around a defect

The rulebook states R4 as a mandate (umbrella `AGENTS.md`, "The ground-truth rules
R1–R10"); this is its operationalization for every page this skill renders and every
hand-authored page beside it.

- **Fix the product first.** When documented behaviour and the code disagree, establish
  which side holds the INTENT, then fix the code BEFORE touching the prose. Editing docs
  to match a bug is forbidden; so is editing them to avoid one.
- **The tells of a routed-around defect:** a `git clone`, a `cd`, or a `-C` standing in
  for a flag that should work; an "except on…" caveat; a "known limitation" note in place
  of a fix. Each describes the defect instead of removing it — and makes it permanent by
  making it look intended.
- **Binary-only reader.** Every command a reader is told to run MUST work with nothing but
  the `charly` binary installed — no clone, no `cd`, no pre-existing project, no unnamed
  companion tool. Write every page for a reader who installed `charly` as a native package
  with NO charly checkout on the machine: no `task` target, no `./bin/charly`, no
  repo-relative path, no verb supplied by a candy that exists only in this repository.
  `--repo <owner>/<repo>` reads a published project without a clone;
  `charly box new project <dir>` starts a local one.
- **The one exception is the INSTALL page**, where the reader obtains charly: it leads
  with the native package and scopes the checkout to working ON charly. A
  repository-maintenance command is named as maintenance this project performs, never as
  a step the reader runs.
- **Anywhere else, needing more than the binary is a PRODUCT DEFECT** — the missing
  capability is the bug, and the fix belongs in `charly`. If that fix is genuinely out of
  scope, file it with its root cause and let the page say nothing rather than something
  false: silence is recoverable, a documented workaround is taught.

## Placement: a RUNTIME plugin, deliberately

`plugin-docs` is **not** listed in `charly/charly.yml`'s `compiled_plugins:`. A dev-time
documentation generator has no business inside every shipped `charly` binary — it is run by
the opencharly/docs repo's deploy workflow against a charly checkout pinned by a CI-time
commit in `deploy.yml` (the docs repo carries no charly submodule anymore), and on a
contributor's machine for local preview, and nowhere else.

charly prescans the declared `docs` word into the Kong grammar before parse and syscall.Exec's
the plugin binary in CLI mode on the first actual `charly docs` invocation. Nothing about the
generator needs the host reverse channel (it reads files and writes markdown), which is exactly
what makes the out-of-process placement free here — the same property that lets `charly candy`
and `charly migrate` run in either placement.

Because it is not in `compiled_plugins:`, the plugin is **not in `go.work`**. Its Go tests
live in its OWN repo (opencharly/plugin-docs, `candy/plugin-docs/*_test.go`); the docs-site
R10 bed (`docs-site-app`/`check-docs`) lives in charly. Generation, the content-drift gate,
the Astro build and the publish all live in the opencharly/docs repo's `deploy.yml`
workflow, which runs generation DIRECTLY with the plugin-docs CLI binary it builds at the
tag pinned in `deploy.yml`'s build step — not via the `charly docs` word — against the charly commit
the workflow pins (a CI-time commit in `deploy.yml`; the charly submodule was removed when
it leaked the whole repo into consumer fetch trees, and `.gitmodules` now carries only the
marketplace).

## Usage

```bash
charly docs generate \
  --out /absolute/path/to/site-content \
  --root /absolute/path/to/opencharly
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--out` | docs content root to write into (required) |
| `--root` | repo root holding `charly.yml`, `candy/`, `box/` (default: cwd) |
| `--plugins` | the opencharly/marketplace checkout the skill corpus is read from (default: `<root>/plugins`) — the docs deploy passes its marketplace submodule |

## What it emits

The generator owns seven top-level entries — `index.md`, `grievances.md`, `vision.md`,
`liberation.md`, `soul.md`, `reference/` and `recipes/` — and rewrites them wholesale each run, so a deleted
source entity disappears from the site instead of lingering as an orphan page. (The table below
expands `reference/` into its sub-trees plus the single file `reference/providers.md`, so it
runs to many rows.) What stays hand-authored is the teaching narrative this repository has no
equivalent of: `start/`, `concepts/` and `guides/`.

**Hand-authored pages are never WRITTEN — but they are read.** The boundary is the `DO-NOT-EDIT`
header, not the path: the prune pass reads every `.md`/`.mdx` under `--out` and removes only those
carrying it, so a page is matched by its content, never inferred from where it sits. The
whole-site link gate then reads hand-authored pages too, deliberately — **a dead site-absolute
link in a `concepts/` or `guides/` page fails generation**, exactly as it would in a generated one.
Treating "hand-authored" as "the generator ignores it" is the trap; it will not overwrite your
page, and it will refuse to build if you link somewhere that does not exist.

The home page is the newest arrival and the one people get wrong: it used to be a hand-authored
`index.mdx` restating `README.md`, and roughly two thirds of it was README prose maintained twice
across a submodule boundary. It is now `index.md`, projected from `README.md`. **Edit the README,
not the page.**

| Tree | Source |
|---|---|
| `index.md` | `README.md`, H1 and tagline dropped (the frontmatter title and hero render them), `https://opencharly.ai/…` links rewritten site-relative, and the repo-relative targets `AGENTS.md`, the marketplace repo's README and `CHANGELOG/README.md` repointed at GitHub or their site equivalent |
| `grievances.md` | `GRIEVANCES.md`, H1 dropped, repo-relative links rewritten for a web reader |
| `vision.md` | `VISION.md`, H1 dropped, repo-relative links rewritten for a web reader |
| `liberation.md` | `LIBERATION.md`, H1 dropped, repo-relative links rewritten — the deliberate easter-egg page, entered last in the sidebar as "Liberation" |
| `soul.md` | `SOUL.md`, H1 dropped, published verbatim — the identity of charly and every charly agent; self-contained, so there are no repo-relative links to rewrite |
| `reference/cli/` | one page per `command:` provider word |
| `reference/candy/` | every defined candy: packages, services, and its `plan:` as an acceptance spec |
| `reference/box/` | every defined box |
| `reference/plugin/` | providers, placement, rendered `schema/*.cue` |
| `reference/providers.md` | the inverted index: every reserved word → its owning plugin |
| `recipes/` | every skill plus its `references/*.md` detail pages |

Every emitted file carries a `DO-NOT-EDIT` header, and **regeneration on a clean tree is a
no-op** — the same drift gate SDD applies to generated Go.

## The `docs:` node — ONE generation config

Everything the assembly above needs is declared in ONE `docs:` kind entity in the charly
repo's TOP-LEVEL `charly.yml` (`<root>/charly.yml` — the project root `generate` is pointed
at, never a module-level manifest). It is CUE-contract-sourced: the closed `#DocsConfig`
contract lives in `spec/schema/docs.cue` (the spec module) and the generator decodes the
node into the GENERATED `spec.DocsConfig` types (`cue:gen`), CUE defaults applied. The node
is discovered by the same name-first walk as `skill:`/`hook:`/`marketplace:` entities — the
`docs` kind discriminator nested under any entity name — and the contract is explicit:

- **ONE docs-site generation config per repo.** More than one `docs:` node in the root
  `charly.yml` is a configuration error; an ABSENT node decodes to the schema defaults,
  which reproduce the pre-config generator exactly (compiled corpus read from
  `charly/charly.yml` + `charly/go.mod`, no release/extra repos) — an un-annotated
  project still generates, identically.
- The node names `sources.compiled` (the `compiled_plugins_path` manifest and the
  `go_mod_path` pins), `sources.release_repos` / `sources.extra_repos`, the
  `marketplace.path`, the `projections` toggles (recipes/cli/providers/candy/box/plugin/
  landing), the hand-authored `output.hand_authored` tree, the `landing.readme` source and
  the `gates` (site_links/sidebar_links/prune). No generation knob is hardcoded; the node
  — or its schema defaults — answers every one.

## Deployment: the drift-proof recipe

Generation, the drift gate, the Astro build and the publish are the SOLE domain of the
opencharly/docs repo's `deploy.yml` (Cloudflare Pages, project `opencharly-docs`). A local
regeneration only ever mirrors it; the recipe that keeps the drift gate — a byte-no-op
regeneration diff on `src/content/docs` — green:

1. **charly is pinned by a CI-time commit in `deploy.yml`** (the `checkout <sha>` in its
   charly-clone step), never by a submodule — the docs checkout's `.gitmodules` carries ONLY the
   marketplace.
2. **The marketplace submodule must sit at the docs-repo-RECORDED gitlink, not at `main`
   HEAD.** The corpus moves independently of the site; the recorded gitlink is the exact
   corpus the committed pages were generated against, while `main` HEAD is wherever the
   corpus PRs happened to land. Checking out `main`'s moving tip and the drift gate
   disagree by construction.
3. **The corpus wiring candy is written BEFORE generate.** The deploy runs
   `python3 .github/docs-corpus/build_wiring.py .github/docs-corpus/pins.tsv` into
   `candy/docs-corpus/charly.yml` inside the charly checkout (`--root`). The pins file is
   the release/extra-repo list in tag form (`plugin-name<TAB>v2026.DDD.CCCC`); the wiring
   candy turns it into the `@github.com/opencharly/<name>/candy/<name>:<tag>` refs the
   release/extra assembly resolves (`pod-*` repos carry the ref at their repo root). A run
   that skips this step regenerates a catalog WITHOUT those repos and drifts.
4. **`--out` sits under the docs checkout with the Astro config present** — the sidebar
   gate (`verifySidebarLinks`) resolves every sidebar `link:` target against the emitted
   routes and walks UP from the content root (`src/content/docs`) to find
   `astro.config.mjs`; an absent config is a HARD error, never a skipped check.
5. **The refs cache must be fresh/CI-equivalent.** Release/extra repos resolve at go.mod
   pins or the NEWEST CalVer tag at generation time through `refs.DownloadRepo`, whose
   fetched trees are cached (`refs.RepoCacheDir`, `CHARLY_REPO_CACHE` override). CI's
   fresh cache resolves newer tags/content than a stale local one, so a stale local cache
   regenerates a site that differs from BOTH the committed pages and CI's — the drift gate
   stays red locally despite a correct `pins.tsv` and correct sources. When the gate is
   red, regenerate from a warm, CI-equivalent cache and confirm the diff is exactly the
   intended projection change.

The deploy invokes generation DIRECTLY — `/tmp/plugin-docs-bin generate --root <charly>
--plugins <marketplace> --out <docs>/src/content/docs` with the CLI binary built at the
pinned plugin tag — so the drift gate never depends on a local `charly` install or its
out-of-process word resolution. The docs landing is therefore: bump the charly CI-time
commit when the pin must advance, carry the regenerated pages, and let the drift gate
prove the two agree.

## Editing a source is a docs landing

Everything in that table is a PROJECTION, and every one of its sources is an ordinary
file people edit for reasons that have nothing to do with the site — a candy's
`description:`, a plan step, a skill's prose. Each such edit re-projects its page, and
from that moment the committed site no longer matches its sources, so the docs repo's
drift gate (its deploy workflow regenerates and fails on any diff) stays red until a docs
PR lands the regenerated pages. **A one-line prose fix is therefore never a one-repo
change.** Plan it as a multi-repo landing before starting, not after a gate says so.

Two chains reach the site, and they are not the same length.

**Candy and box prose — ONE hop.** `reference/candy/` and `reference/box/` are read
straight off disk, walking each repo as its own project root. Editing a
`candy/<name>/charly.yml` `description:` or `plan:` re-projects
`reference/candy/<name>.md` in the same tree, immediately. The docs PR (regenerating at
the pinned charly) belongs to the same cutover as the candy edit.

**Skill prose — TWO hops, with a direct complement.** `recipes/` is NOT read from
`candy/*/charly.yml` — but the generator DOES project candy `skill:` entities directly
from its own remote-aware walk (`collectCandySkills`), the complement that keeps a moved
candy's recipe references resolving on the site even before the marketplace regeneration
lands (the stale-marketplace gap `/charly-tools:crabbox-cli` measures — see the tests
section). The long path still holds: a skill is authored as a `skill:` entity in its
owning candy; `charly marketplace generate` projects that into the
opencharly/marketplace repo (`<family>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`), and
`charly docs generate` reads **that projection** (via `--plugins` — the marketplace
checkout the docs repo pins as a submodule) first. Editing a `skill:`
entity therefore changes nothing on the site until `charly marketplace generate` has
run and the marketplace landing merges; the docs repo pins the marketplace in its own
`.gitmodules` (branch `main`), so the change reaches readers once the marketplace main
advances and a docs PR regenerates the site at the moved corpus. **Advancing the corpus
without regenerating `docs` in the same change is what leaves the published site stale**,
and nothing except the docs repo's drift gate will say so — which is precisely how the
mirror has fallen behind before.

The ordering this forces — regenerate the projection, land the producer repo, then the
consumer (docs) and its charly pin — is `/charly-internals:git-workflow` B6's
producer→consumer rule applied to documentation. That skill owns the landing sequence;
the mechanism above is what makes the sequence necessary, and is all this page needs to
carry.

## Defined, not default-active

The catalog enumerates what is **defined**, never what happens to be switched on. This is not a
stylistic preference; the obvious surfaces are actively wrong for the purpose:

- `charly box list boxes` lists **enabled** boxes, and resolves through main's `import:` closure —
  which pulls arch, cachyos and fedora but **not** debian or ubuntu. A catalog built on it omits
  every `debian.*` and `ubuntu.*` box (ten definitions that are checked out and have their own
  skills) while duplicating ten arch boxes under transitive `cachyos.arch.*` aliases.
- A plugin absent from `compiled_plugins:` still loads out-of-process when a plan references its
  word, so "in the binary" is not the same set as "exists".

So discovery is not the walked trees alone: the catalog is ONE assembly (R2/R5,
`assembleCatalog`) unioning three sets —

1. the **walked closure** — remote-ref-aware (`candywalk.CollectEntitiesRemote`):
   the superproject plus every `box/<distro>` submodule, resolving any
   `@github.com/opencharly/…` ref in a walked `require:`/`candy:` list through the
   standalone fetch (`refs.DownloadRepo`);
2. the **compiled corpus** — every name in the `docs:` node's `compiled_plugins_path`
   manifest (`compiled_plugins:` list), each pinned by a require in the `go_mod_path`
   go.mod (module `github.com/opencharly/<name>/candy/<name>`); the Go tag form
   `v0.YYYYDDD.C` is mapped onto the repo's CalVer tag `v2026.DDD.CCCC` (the counter
   re-zero-padded to four — `compiledPluginRef`), the repo fetched at that tag and
   walked as a remote entity. A compiled-in plugin is therefore documented **by
   construction**, even when no walked tree declares it — the compiled blind spot is
   closed;
3. the **release/extra repos** from the `docs:` config lists — bare names resolved
   through the same `DownloadRepo` seam, at the go.mod require pin when the compiled
   corpus go.mod requires the repo, else the repo's NEWEST CalVer tag at generation
   time (`refs.GitLatestTag`).

Every set is the DEFINED set, never the switched-on set — the two bullets above stay the
reason the enabled surfaces cannot be trusted.

## Cross-reference rewriting

The skill corpus is densely self-linked in harness syntax — references across many distinct
targets in the **skill files** the generator reads, `/charly-check:check` alone appearing many
times. (Candy, box and `VISION.md` sources carry references too; those go through other emitters
and are not counted here.)

**3654 of those are rewritten** into site links — every reference in a skill BODY. The remaining
11 sit in `SKILL.md` frontmatter `description:` fields and never reach the published page at all:
`splitFrontmatter` removes the frontmatter before the body is rewritten, and `firstLine` then
truncates the description to its first sentence for the page subtitle, which drops all 11. They
resolve, so nothing breaks — but that is why, not because they are published unlinked.

An unresolvable reference **in a body** fails generation rather than emitting a dead link; a
reference in a `description:` is never gated, because it is never published.

### One sanitizer: page path == served URL == link target

Every emitted page path AND every link target run through ONE sanitizer
(`sanitizeSegment`): lowercase ASCII letters and digits survive, every other byte renders
as `-`. That is not cosmetic — Astro strips `.` and `:` when it derives a route slug from
a file name, so a segment built from an entity identity (a repo path, a CalVer tag, a
namespaced name) would be served only at a mangled URL (`githubcom/…/plugin-checkv20262…`)
while every generated natural link to it 404s — 851 published URLs, measured on the live
site. Entity pages are additionally namespaced by DIRECTORY (a slash, not a dot — a
dotted filename would also be slug-mangled), so `fedora/check-pod` survives where
`fedora.check-pod` would not. Because the sanitizer is the one transform behind both file
names and link targets, the page path, the served route and the link target are the same
string BY CONSTRUCTION — a raw identity can never leak a dot or a colon into a page name
while its links disagree.

Three guards keep real content from being mangled into links, each earned from an actual corpus
case:

1. the skill part must start with a letter — else `redis://charly-redis:6379` matches;
2. the reference must not follow `/` — URL authorities;
3. it must not follow a word character — image tags like `localhost/charly-selkies-kde:latest`.

`references/<file>.md` pointers (backticked paths, never markdown links) resolve to the skill's
own child page.

### Authoring consequence: you cannot write a fake reference

Because the gate fails closed, a **well-formed reference in a skill BODY must resolve** — there is
no escape syntax. A skill therefore cannot write `/charly-` followed by two real-looking lowercase
words as a throwaway example: that shape matches, resolves to nothing, and fails the docs build.

Write generic forms with angle-bracket placeholders instead — `<` is not a letter, so the
pattern never matches:

```
/charly-<plugin>:<skill>     ✅ safe in prose
```

This is not hypothetical, and it bit twice in one sitting. The first draft of
`/charly-tools:docs-site` used a made-up two-word reference as its example of an unresolvable
one, and the generator dutifully aborted — the skill documenting the gate tripped the gate. The
fix's own "don't do this" example then tripped it a second time. Failing closed is still the
right behaviour (a typo'd real reference is far likelier than a deliberate fake one), so
describe the bad shape rather than spelling it.

## Why declarative sources, not the CLI's help output

The host renders every dynamic command word with a generic stub description, intercepts the
depth-1 `--help` itself, and plugin-served help arrives in at least three mutually incompatible
formats with no machine-readable dump. Parsing that would be the fragile shim R3 forbids. Every
fact the site needs is already declared: `plugin.providers`, the per-plugin `schema/*.cue`, and
each candy's `description:`.

The trade-off is stated rather than hidden: command PARENTHOOD is a Go method
(`CommandParent()`), not a manifest field, so CLI pages name the word and its owning plugin
without asserting where it nests. The narrative CLI guide covers the nesting and the three
core-spine words (`box`, `version`, `reap-orphans`) that are not `command:` providers.

## Tests: hermetic by construction

The generator-wiring tests are HERMETIC: they run against self-contained fixtures, never
against the live corpus or the network. `testdata/project` is a minimal charly project
whose `docs:` node DISABLES the compiled corpus and declares no release/extra repos — so
the catalog assembly never fetches — plus the README/VISION/GRIEVANCES/LIBERATION
narratives the root pages project; `testdata/marketplace` is a one-plugin corpus that is
internally consistent BY CONSTRUCTION; `testdata/site` seeds the hand-authored pages the
generated landing links to, and the fixture writes the `astro.config.mjs` the sidebar gate
reads. The fetch seams — the repoResolver pair, `download` (`refs.DownloadRepo`) and
`latestTag` (`refs.GitLatestTag`) — are INJECTABLE into `assembleCatalog`, so the
assembly itself runs on fixtures without any network.

Bare-clone tests use fixtures so they perform zero network fetches: the
`repoResolver` pair, `download` (`refs.DownloadRepo`) and `latestTag`
(`refs.GitLatestTag`) are injectable, and the fixture tree carries the minimal
project, corpus and `astro.config.mjs` the passes read. A test that fetched the
real corpus would instead depend on whatever the pinned marketplace checkout
happens to hold, so the fixtures pin the input. The `CHARLY_DOCS_MARKETPLACE`
environment override wins over the fixture corpus when set — the seam the RDD bed uses to
pass a freshly regenerated corpus. The ONE deliberate network test is
`TestCollectEntitiesRemote_ResolvesMovedCandy`, which fetches the real `layer-ripgrep`
pilot repo at its newest tag to prove the actual `refs.DownloadRepo` fetch path (the
Phase-3 R10 gate) — a single test, not the wiring suite.

## Cross-References

- `/charly-tools:docs-site` — the candy + `check-docs` bed that builds and proves the site.
- `/charly-internals:plugin` — placement, the provider model, the CUE-schema contract.
- `/charly-internals:skills` — the skill corpus this site publishes.

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke before running or modifying `charly docs`, editing `candy/plugin-docs`, touching the
generated trees in the opencharly/docs repo, or changing anything the generator reads (a candy's
`description:`, a plugin's `providers:` or CUE schema, a skill's frontmatter or cross-references).
