// pruneGeneratedPages deletes every page carrying the generated header before a run emits its
// replacements.
//
// Without it the generator can only ever ADD. It writes each page it knows about and never looks
// at what is already there, so a page it no longer emits — one whose source was deleted, whose
// generator was removed, or which was renamed — stays in the tree forever, and every gate above it
// reports a pass:
//
//   - the docs repo's drift gate compares the committed tree against a regeneration. A stale page
//     is identical in both, so it is not drift.
//   - `verifySiteLinks` walks the emitted tree, so links INTO the stale page still resolve.
//
// That combination is worse than a missing check, because it reads as proof. It was measured, not
// theorised: removing the generateGrievances call and re-running the generator reported
// "already up to date (regeneration is a no-op)" and exit 0 while the generator no longer produced
// the page at all.
//
// Pruning first rather than diffing afterwards keeps this to one function and no threaded state:
// generation rewrites every page it still emits, so whatever does not come back was not emitted.
// A generation that fails midway therefore leaves visible holes rather than a tree that looks
// complete — which is the honest outcome, since a failed run has not proved anything.
//
// The header is the whole safety boundary. Hand-authored pages (`start/`, `concepts/`, `guides/`)
// do not carry it and are never touched; a file is read and matched, never inferred from its path.
