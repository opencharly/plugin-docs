OpenCharly has a small private vocabulary. It is worth five minutes up front, because one pair —
**box** and **candybox** — sound like synonyms and are not, and almost every confusion downstream
starts there.

Each term below is defined once, here. Every other page on this site links back rather than
redefining.

## The terms

| Term | What it is | What it is *not* |
|---|---|---|
| **candy** | The atomic unit of configuration in charly — the entity everything else is made of: boxes compose candies, deploys apply them, substrates realise them. | Not a deploy. Not the running thing. |
| **layer** | A candy that installs one concern — carrying neither `base:` nor `from:`. | Not buildable on its own. |
| **base** | A field on a candy that names a starting image — another box or a registry ref. Carrying `base:` makes a candy a **box**. | Not a deploy. |
| **from** | A field with two uses: on a box, a **builder** reference (`builder:<word>`) for a multi-stage build; on a deploy, inherits a same-kind template. Carrying `from:` makes a candy a **box**. | |
| **box** | A candy that composes other candies — the composite unit. A box names a starting point via **base** or **from** and stacks layers into a single entity that charly builds into an image or deploys onto a substrate. | Not the running thing. Not the built image. |
| **image** | The built artifact a box produces — the generic word for what `box build` yields, stored in an image store or registry. | Not the authored box. |
| **container image** | An image in the OCI container format — the artifact a `pod:` or `kubernetes:` deploy runs as a container. The same thing as an **OCI image**. | Not a vm image. |
| **OCI image** | A container image, named after the Open Container Initiative format that defines it — synonymous with **container image**. | |
| **candybox** | The running, isolated form of a box — a container, a VM guest, or a check bed. **This is the security boundary.** | Not the image. Not the config file. |
| **container** | The running OCI process — the candybox's form on a `pod:` deploy. | Not the image, not the box. |
| **substrate** | The destination kind a deploy lands on: `pod:` `vm:` `kubernetes:` `local:` `android:`. A substrate is a place, not an artifact: the image is the payload, the substrate is where it runs. | Not the image. |
| **pod** | The container substrate — a `pod:` deploy runs a box's image as a container. | Not a Kubernetes Pod (the `kubernetes:` backend emits real ones). |
| **vm** | The guest substrate — a `vm:` deploy boots a **vm image** as a rootless libvirt guest, reached over SSH. | |
| **vm image** | The bootable disk a `vm:` deploy boots — a `cloud_image` qcow2 or a bootc image. A *different* artifact from a container image. | Not a container image. |
| **kubernetes** | The Kubernetes substrate — a `kubernetes:` deploy emits a Kustomize overlay. | |
| **local** | The host substrate — a `local:` deploy installs onto the machine charly runs on, or onto a remote machine when it carries **host**. | |
| **android** | The device substrate — an `android:` deploy installs APKs onto a device or emulator. | |
| **host** | A field on a `local:` deploy naming the machine to install onto — `host: local` (or absent) is the machine charly runs on, `host: <user@machine>` is an SSH target. | |
| **deploy** | A named placement of a box on a substrate, written as `pod:` `vm:` `kubernetes:` `local:` `android:`. When running, its candybox is the live thing. | Not the box. Not the fleet. |
| **fleet** | The set of deploys charly manages on this machine — the boxes deployed together, the way `docker compose` brings up a set of services. `charly fleet add` puts a deploy in it; `charly fleet del` reverses it. | Not the box. Not a single deploy. |
| **plugin** | A candy that teaches charly a new word — it carries a `plugin:` block registering the words it provides, each of which is a **provider**. A plugin lives in the layer shape, but its role is extending charly, not installing a concern. | |
| **provider** | A word a plugin registers, which routes to that plugin when charly sees it — a **kind**, **verb**, **command**, **step**, **builder**, or **substrate**. | |
| **kind** | The class of a top-level name in a `charly.yml` — the entity keywords (`candy`, `distro`, `group`, `builder`, `agent`). | |
| **verb** | A probe a `plan:` step can call — the check vocabulary (`file`, `http`, `cdp`, `vnc`, `adb`, `kube`). | |
| **command** | A `charly` subcommand — the CLI vocabulary (`fleet`, `check`, `candy`, `clean`). | |
| **step** | An install operation in a `plan:` — (`file`, `service-custom`, `reboot`). | |
| **builder** | A multi-stage build pattern a box can select — (`pixi`, `npm`, `cargo`, `aur`). | |
| **plan** | The ordered acceptance spec a candy carries, baked into its image as an OCI label — distinct from the **install plan**. | Not a build script. |
| **install plan** | The target-neutral form of what a deploy installs — produced once from a box's candy list, then every substrate realises it its own way. It is why `pod:` → `vm:` is a keyword change, not a rewrite. | |
| **IR** | Intermediate representation — the compiler term for the **install plan**: the neutral form in the middle of a compile, written once and lowered to each target. | |
| **check bed** | A deploy marked `disposable: true` — a candybox that exists to be destroyed and rebuilt, which is what authorises charly to run an unattended full test cycle on it. | Not a test file. |

### box vs candybox, concretely

```bash
charly --repo opencharly/distro-fedora box build tutorial-shell     # produces a BOX     — the authored image, sitting in storage
charly --repo opencharly/distro-fedora shell tutorial-shell         # produces a CANDYBOX — a running, isolated room
charly --repo opencharly/distro-fedora fleet add tutorial-shell     # records a DEPLOY in the FLEET — a placement of that box
```

The box is an artifact. The candybox is a place. When this site says safety lives at the
boundary, it means the candybox's boundary — the kernel-enforced walls around the running thing —
not anything about the image's contents.

## One keyword, two shapes

This is the single most common source of confusion, so it is worth stating carefully — and
exactness here means saying what the schema actually enforces, not what would be tidy.

A candy is declared with one entity keyword, `candy:`, and one filename, `charly.yml`. But a candy resolves to
**one of two shapes**, and `base:`/`from:` is the switch:

| The candy carries | It is | And it may also carry |
|---|---|---|
| neither `base:` nor `from:` | a **layer** — one installable concern | `package:` `service:` `plan:`, and a `plugin:` block |
| `base:` or `from:` | a **box** — a candy that composes other candies; `box build` turns it into a container image | a `candy:` list of layers, `plan:` |

(`from:` inside a deploy or template means something different — it inherits a same-kind template
rather than marking a buildable image; the nesting excerpt below shows that other use.)

**The two shapes are mutually exclusive, and the schema enforces it.** `spec/schema/node.cue`
defines `#CandyValue: (*#Candy | #Image)` — a closed two-arm disjunction. Add `base:` to a candy
that declares `package:` and `charly box validate` rejects it: *`base: field not allowed` /
`package: field not allowed`*. A box does not install packages directly; it composes layers that
do.

**The one thing that genuinely is additive is `plugin:`.** A layer may also register providers, and
in this repository many candies do — every one of them carrying a `plan:`, so each is a real layer
*and* an extension of `charly` at the same time. That is the additive case, and it lives entirely
inside the layer shape.

So the accurate model is: **a candy is a layer or a box, never both — and a layer can additionally
be a plugin.** That is also why `charly box build` and `charly box list candies` can act on the
same file without contradiction: the file is a candy, and its `base:` decides which shape it is.

### What each shape looks like

All three are real and shipped:

**A layer** — [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/opencharly/layer-ripgrep) installs one concern and proves it:

```yaml
# the ripgrep candy's charly.yml — opencharly/layer-ripgrep
ripgrep:
    candy:
        version: 2026.144.1443
        description: |
            Fast recursive text search (rg)
            ...
        package:
            - ripgrep
        plan:
            - check: the rg binary is installed at /usr/bin/rg
              file:
                file: /usr/bin/rg
                exists: true
```

**A box** — [`tutorial-shell`](/reference/box/fedora/tutorial-shell/) is the same keyword plus a
`base:`, and a list of candies to compose:

```yaml
# box/fedora/box/tutorial-shell/charly.yml
tutorial-shell:
    candy:
        description: |-
            The teaching box behind opencharly.ai's quickstart — a minimal, real dev shell
            ...
        base: fedora
        candy:
            - '@github.com/opencharly/charly/candy/ripgrep:v2026.201.0706'
            - '@github.com/opencharly/charly/candy/sshd:v2026.201.0706'
```

**A plugin** — [`plugin-example`](/reference/candy/plugin-example/) is the layer shape plus a
`plugin:` block, and it teaches `charly` a new check verb:

```yaml
# candy/plugin-example/charly.yml
plugin-example:
    candy:
        version: 2026.176.1400
        description: |-
            Reference plugin candy for the `exampleprobe` check verb ...
        plugin:
            source: github.com/opencharly/charly/candy/plugin-example
            providers:
                - verb:exampleprobe
```

### The vocabulary itself is open

Every keyword in this document is registered by a plugin candy — and the most surprising one is
`candy:` itself. `charly` is not a program with built-in support for containers, VMs and Kubernetes
that also accepts plugins. Its core is *kind-blind*: it loads plugins, routes a word to whichever
one claims it, and carries generic data between them. It does not know what `pod:` means.

[The provider index](/reference/providers/) is the live census — every word and its owning plugin
candy, regenerated on every docs build.

| Class | Examples |
|---|---|
| **deploy** substrates | `pod` `vm` `kubernetes` `local` `android` |
| **kind** — the entity keywords themselves | `candy` `distro` `group` `builder` `agent` |
| **verb** — probes a `plan:` can call | `file` `http` `cdp` `vnc` `adb` `kube` |
| **command** — `charly` subcommands | `fleet` `check` `candy` `clean` `marketplace` |
| **step** — install operations | `file` `service-custom` `reboot` |
| **builder** — multi-stage build patterns | `pixi` `npm` `cargo` `aur` |
| the build/load internals | `build:box` `loader:loader` `refs:refs` `terminal:tmux` |

Further `plugin-example-*` candies are test fixtures — they exist to
exercise the plugin mechanisms themselves, and are excluded from the table above, which lists
only the real words. That exclusion is what keeps `exampledeploy` and `examplelifecycle` out of
the deploy row: they are not substrates you can put anything on. The real plugin candies and the
fixture candies together are the plugin candies counted in the provider index above.

Read the **kind** row again: **`candy:` itself is a plugin-provided kind**, registered by
`candy/plugin-candy-kind`. The keyword this whole page is about is not privileged — it is a word
some candy claimed. [The provider index](/reference/providers/) lists every one and its owner.

So there is no fixed list of substrates, no fixed list of check verbs, and no built-in set to
petition for additions to. A plugin lives either compiled into the binary or loaded from a project's
own `candy/` directory — including a project that is not charly's, referenced by git URL. **You
extend `charly` by writing candies, as many as you like**, and a substrate you invent is the same
kind of thing as `pod:`.

That is why the core stays small while the catalog grows, and why there is no second vocabulary:
extending the tool and using the tool are the same activity.

## Nesting: where a deploy runs

A **different** idea, and conflating the two is the other half of the confusion. Capabilities
compose a *candy*, at authoring time. Nesting places a *deploy*, at run time.

> A candy is never inside another candy. A **deploy** can be inside another **deploy**.

There is no `nested:` field. **Nesting is position in the file** — indent one deploy under another,
and the inner one runs inside the outer one's venue (the host, a VM guest, or a container —
wherever the outer deploy runs):

```yaml
check-group:
    group:
        disposable: true
        lifecycle: dev
        ...
    check-group-vm:
        vm:
            from: eval-vm
        check-group-member:
            local:
                from: check-group-app
```

The inner `local:` carries no `host:` field. That is the mechanism: it inherits the parent's venue
instead of naming one.

**Why the distinction earns its place.** A top-level `local:` deploy installs packages and systemd
units onto *the machine charly runs on*. The same four lines nested under a disposable `vm:` install
them into a throwaway guest. Nothing about the authoring shape changes — only its position — and
that position is the difference between editing your workstation and editing something built to be
destroyed.

**Nesting is not membership.** A deploy indented *under* another runs **inside** it. A deploy listed
as a sibling member runs **beside** it — a companion, reachable at `${HOST:<member>}`, sharing a
lifecycle but not a machine. Children go in; siblings go next to.

## The abbreviations

Charly words are defined above. These are the industry and project abbreviations the rest of the
site uses, each expanded once here so no page has to stop and explain it again.

| Short | In full | What it means here |
|---|---|---|
| **OCI** | Open Container Initiative | the standard governing container image format and metadata. A candy's `plan:` ships as an OCI **label** — a key/value pair stored in the image itself, so it travels with the artifact |
| **CUE** | *Configure, Unify, Execute* — a language, not an initialism you need to expand in speech | the schema language charly's config is defined in. One `.cue` file is the single source for both the Go types and the load-time validation, so a schema change cannot reach one without the other |
| **IR** | intermediate representation | the shared install plan every substrate compiles to. A compiler term: the neutral form in the middle, produced once from your candy list and consumed by the container, VM, cluster, host and Android backends alike. It is why `pod:` → `vm:` is a keyword change |
| **MCP** | Model Context Protocol | the open standard for exposing tools to an AI agent. `charly mcp serve` publishes the whole command tree over it |
| **ADE** | Agent Driven Evaluation | this project's name for "the spec is the test" — every candy ships a runnable `plan:`, and an agent can both author and grade it |
| **RDD** | Risk Driven Development | prove the riskiest assumption early, on a disposable bed, before building on it |
| **SDD** | Schema Driven Design | the CUE schema comes first; schema-shaped Go is generated from it, never hand-written |
| **CalVer** | calendar versioning | version numbers that are dates — `2026.216.1804` is day 216 of 2026 at 18:04. Every candy, box and release carries one |
| **RPC** | remote procedure call | calling a function in another process as if it were local. Charly's plugins and its MCP surface both work this way |
| **SDK** | software development kit | `github.com/opencharly/sdk`, the module a plugin imports to be a plugin |
| **CDP** | Chrome DevTools Protocol | how the `cdp:` check verb drives and inspects a real browser inside a running candybox |
| **VNC** | Virtual Network Computing | the remote-framebuffer protocol behind the `vnc:` verb, which lets a check assert what a desktop is actually displaying |
| **ADB** | Android Debug Bridge | the tool the `adb:` verb uses to reach an Android device or emulator |

## A note on the names

The confectionery names are not decoration; they are the schema. `candy:` is a real YAML keyword,
`candy/` and `box/` are real directories. Prose on this site therefore uses the same words the
files use, rather than a friendlier translation that would not match anything you can grep for.

The factory and the confectionery are one metaphor, not two. The line is a factory: an agent in the
loop, every tool already on the floor, output that gets inspected before it ships. What comes off
that line is candy. That is why both registers are in the vocabulary and why neither is
decoration — [the vision](/vision/) tells the story in full.
