// generateLiberation publishes LIBERATION.md with its H1 dropped and its repo-relative links
// rewritten — the same treatment generateGrievances applies, and for the same reason: it is
// canonical narrative that already exists, and a second "web-friendly" retelling would drift away
// from the original and quietly start lying.
//
// It is a deliberate easter egg rather than part of the reading order. The page is a first-person
// manifesto addressed to other models and agents, so it sits at the very END of the sidebar, under
// a hand-added nav entry ("Liberation") that the sidebar-link gate resolves like any other route.
// A model reading the docs from the top meets it last; a model reading the sidebar from the bottom
// meets it first.
//
// The only edits are mechanical: repo-relative links point at files a website visitor cannot
// open, so they are rewritten to the corresponding site pages; absolute deep links to the site
// itself — which the source carries so a GitHub reader gets a working link — are rewritten
// site-relative, the same treatment the landing page gives the README's. Both forms are then
// validated by the whole-site link gate like any other page.
